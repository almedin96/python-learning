WEEK 1 TASKS - Python Basics:
1. Write a program that, between two numbers, prints the one with higher value
- Sample values: 5, 87
- pected Result : 87
2. Write a program that prints True or False whether a number is within 1000 or 2000(both upper and lower limit included).
- Sample value: 1303
- Expected Result : True
3. Write a program that accepts an integer (n) and computes the value of n+nn+nnn.
- Sample value of n is 5
- Expected Result : 615
4. Write a program that calculates number of seconds to pass based on days input
- Sample value: 5 days
- Expected Result : 432000 seconds
5. Write a Python program to display the current date and time.
- Sample Output : Current date and time : 2014-07-05 14:34:14
6. Write a program that calculates the length of a string.
- Sample value: I am my moon
- Expected Result : 12
7. Write a program to find sample word in a string.
- Sample string: Today was a good day.
- Sample word: good
- Expected Result : True
8. Write a program to sum all the numbers in a list.
- Sample list: [2, 2, 5, 1]
- Expected Result : 10
9. Write a program to remove duplicates from a list.
- Sample list: [2, 2, 5, 1]
- Expected Result : [2, 5, 1]
10. Write a program that creates sentences from the words in a list.
- Sample list: ['In', 'the', 'last', 'episode', 'of', 'Breaking', 'Bad']
- Expected Result : 'In the last episode of Breaking Bad'
11. Write a program to find those numbers which are divisible by 7 and multiple of 5, between 1500 and 2700 (both included).
12. Write a program which iterates the integers from 1 to 50. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
13. Write a program that accepts a word from the user and reverse it.
- Sample word: 'DZONI'
- Expected Result : 'INOZD'
14. Write a program to convert temperatures to and from celsius, fahrenheit.
[ Formula : c/5 = f-32/9 [ where c = temperature in celsius and f = temperature in fahrenheit ]
- Expected Output :
  60°C is 140 in Fahrenheit
  45°F is 7 in Celsius
15. Write a program to check the validity of password input by users.
Validation :
- At least 1 letter between [a-z] and 1 letter between [A-Z].
- At least 1 number between [0-9].
- At least 1 character from [$#@].
- Minimum length 6 characters.
- Maximum length 16 characters.
